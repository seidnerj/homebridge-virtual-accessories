## About Virtual Accessories For Homebridge

This plugin is inspired by Nick Farina's most excellent 🎸 [`homebridge-dummy`](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge-dummy) plugin, which formed the backbone of my HomeKit automations. As `homebridge-dummy` was no longer being maintained, I was motivated to create a new solution.

[**Update:** `homebridge-dummy` has found a new maintainer and is being updated, so check it out.]

But the purpose of this plugin is also to provide a single solution for creating different types of virtual HomeKit accessories. In my automations it has replaced seven separate plugins, each of which provided part of the functionality I needed, and all of which had gone unmaintained or abandoned. It also became annoying to have to figure out which plugin provided what functionality, or managed which accessory, each time I wanted or needed to make a change. The drama!

The downside to a single plugin is trading ease of accessory maintenance for a single point of failure. However, this is work in progress so I will be releasing bug fixes and updates. Also, I will slowly add new accessories and functionality, either as I need them, or, more likely, in response to requests by users who find this plugin useful.

Currently, these are the implemented virtual accessories:

-   **Battery.** Allows you to create a virtual battery service. The "charging state" and "battery level" properties can be set via a [webhook call](#webhook-service-configuration).
-   **Door.** Allows you to create a virtual door.
-   **Doorbell.** Allows you to use a button as a doorbell and have it play a chime on HomePods. Due to [issues with HomeKit](#issues-with-homekit), you will need the free [Eve app](https://www.evehome.com/en-us/eve-app) to control its settings.
-   **Fan.** Allows you to create a virtual fan and set rotation direction and speed.
-   **Filter Maintenance.** Allows you to create a recurring filter maintenance/replacement schedule, with a lifetime up to 30 days.
-   **Garage Door.** Allows you to create a virtual garage door. Generates a HomeKit notification when the accessory's state changes. CarPlay will display the Garage widget on the display when you approach your home. The "obstruction detected" property can be set via a [webhook call](#webhook-service-configuration). The accessory state will show that an obstruction was detected and the current state will be set to `STOPPED`. The "obstruction detected" property will be reset on the next call to open or close the garage door.
-   **Heater/Cooler.** Allows you to create a virtual thermostat/AC accessory. You can select heater only, cooler only, or heater + cooler combo. The heater/cooler temperature sensor can be updated via a [webhook call](#webhook-service-configuration). Based on the threshold values, the accessory will switch to the appropriate operating state, according to the supported states.
-   **Humidifier/Dehumidifier.** Allows you to create a virtual humidifier/dehumidifier. You can select humidifier only, dehumidifier only, or humidifier + dehumidifier combo. The humidifier/dehumidifier humidity sensor can be updated via a [webhook call](#webhook-service-configuration). Based on the threshold values, the accessory will switch to the appropriate operating state, according to the supported states.
-   **Lightbulb.** Allows you to create virtual white, white ambiance, color lightbulbs. In the Home app, this can be used as a dimmer switch.
-   **Lock.** Allows you to create a virtual lock. Generates a HomeKit notification when the accessory's state changes.
-   **Security System.** Allows you to create a virtual security system. Generates a HomeKit notification when the accessory's state changes. The Security System can be put in a triggered state via a [webhook call](#webhook-service-configuration).
-   **Speaker.** Allows you to create a virtual speaker.
-   **Television.** Allows you to create a virtual television.
-   **Valve.** Allows you to create different types of virtual valves: generic, irrigation, shower head, or water faucet.
-   **Window.** Allows you to create a virtual window.
-   **Window Covering.** Allows you to create virtual blinds and shades.
-   **Switch.** Allows you to create a number of different types of virtual switches.
    - **Plain old switches.** What it says on the label.
    - **Normally on/off switches.** The default state of the switch can be set to "on" or "off". This is also the default state when Homebridge restarts. If you pair it with a timer, the switch will revert back to the default state when the timer expires.
    - **Stateful switches.** The state of the switch persists across restarts of Homebridge. This includes timed switches.
    - **Switches with companion sensors.** The switch will trigger a companion sensor when it changes state, generating a HomeKit-native notification in the Home app. Supports optional delay configuration where only the "triggered" state is delayed, while returning to "normal" is immediate. Selecting a critical sensor type will allow notifications to bypass Focuses like "Do Not Disturb". This is just the easier way of implementing a switch triggered sensor.
    - **Dimmer switches.** To create a dimmer switch use a virtual lightbulb.
    - **Timed switches.** This is a way to introduce timers into HomeKit. The switch will revert back to its default state when the timer expires. If the switch is stateful, the timer will be restored after a restart of Homebridge. While care is taken to restore the timer with the appropriate time correction, **absolute accuracy is not guaranteed and should not be expected**. The accuracy of the restored timer will be affected, among other things, by the hardware and software Homebridge is running on, the number of plugins installed, the order with which the plugins are restored, etc.
-   **Sensor.** Allows you to create different types of virtual sensors. If Activity Notifications are enabled in the Home app, sensors will generate notifications when their state changes in response to a detected event. Some types of notifications, classified as `critical` by Homekit, are allowed to bypass Focuses like `Do Not Disturb` and some are allowed to appear in CarPlay. Sensors can be activated by different triggers. Currently, the available triggers are:
    - **Host Ping trigger.** Actvates the sensor after a configurable number of failed attempts to ping a network host. The sensor resets when ping is successful.
    - **Cron trigger.** Activates the sensor when the time and date match the schedule deascribed by a cron expression. The sensor resets after a brief delay.
    - **Sun Events trigger.** Activates the sensor when the selected event happens: sunrise, sunset, and golden hour (for the photographers among us). The sensor resets after a brief delay.
    - **Switch trigger.** To create a switch triggered sensor, create a virtual switch accessory with a companion sensor. Supports optional delay configuration for triggering. This is just the easier way of implementing a switch triggered sensor. A future version may provide the ability to create this pairing as a sensor with a switch trigger.
    - **Webhook trigger.** Triggers the sensor via a [webhook call](#webhook-service-configuration). To reset the sensor, trigger it via another web call.
 
- **Timer.** To create a timer, create a timed switch.

## Installation

You can install this plugin via the Homebridge UI or from the command line by typing:

```
npm install -g homebridge-virtual-accessories
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Virtual Accessories For Homebridge has dependencies on platform-native libraries, which get compiled for that particular platform at install time. Therefore you will need to make sure that the platform you are installing this plugin on has the necessary build tools available. The official Homebridge Docker image and the Homebridge Linux (apt) install, both provide all the necessary tools. If you are choosing to install on other platforms, you will require the appropriate technical skills to do the necessary installs. I have neither the capacity nor the hardware to test installs on every platform that Homebridge runs on. Below are platform specific installation notes, which I will update as users of this plugin report issues.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you manually update the Node.js version that Homebridge is running on, you will need to ensure that the platform-native library `raw-socket` will also be updated. Run the following commands immediately after the Node.js update:
> ```
> npm uninstall raw-socket
> npm install raw-socket
> ```

> [!CAUTION]
> Due to Virtual Accessories For Homebridge using platform-native modules, when updating Node.js, if the `raw-socket` module is also not updated (see above), it may cause the plugin to fail to load and Homebridge to delete all of the plugin's accessories. It is therefore **strongly** recommended to toggle the `Keep Accessories Of Uninstalled Plugins` option to on, at least while performing updates. This setting is in the `Settings` screen, `Startup & Environment` section:
> 
> <img src="assets/keepaccessories.png" height="240" />

### Docker

If you are installing Virtual Accessories For Homebridge in the Homebridge Docker image, you will need to add the following lines to `config/startup.sh`:

```
npm uninstall raw-socket
npm install raw-socket
```

This will ensure that if the version of Node.js is updated in the Docker image, the platform-native library `raw-socket` will also be updated after the container starts up.

### MacOS

If you are installing Virtual Accessories For Homebridge in a Homebridge instance running on macOS, you will need to ensure that Xcode or the Xcode Command Line Tools are installed. To install Xcode or the Xcode Command Line Tools, use the following command:

```
xcode-select --install
```

### Synology

If you are installing Virtual Accessories For Homebridge in a Homebridge instance running on Synology DSM, you will need to ensure that a build toolchain is installed.

This document provides steps for installing the Entware toolchain and other needed packages: [DSM 7: Enable Compiling Of Native Modules](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge-syno-spk/wiki/DSM-7:-Enable-Compiling-Of-Native-Modules).

The [Synology DSM 7.2.2 Developer Guide](https://help.synology.com/developer-guide/getting_started/system_requirement.html) provides information to setup the build tools for Synology DSM platforms.

## Configuration

You can configure the plugin from the Homebridge UI, or by ediiting the JSON configuration directly in the Homebridge JSON Config editor.
In the UI, required fields will be marked with an asterisk (*) and you will not be allowed to save the configuration if the required fields are not filled in.

`accessoryID`, `accessoryName`, and `accessoryType` are required fields for all the accessories.

The configuration is validated on startup, so if an accessory is misconfigured, you will see error entries in the logs to help you correct the configuration. The log entries will indicate the misconfigured fields and look something like this:

```
[12/21/2024, 12:35:38 AM] [Virtual Accessories Platform] Skipping accessory. Configuration is invalid: { "accessoryID": "12345", "accessoryName": "My Switch", ... }
[12/21/2024, 12:35:38 AM] [Virtual Accessories Platform] Invalid fields: [switchDefaultState]
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `accessoryID` uniquely identifies an accessory and each accessory must have a different value. This is because HomeKit requires a unique and unmodifiable serial number to identify an accessory. The accessory ID acts as a virtual serial number for each accessory that must be unique and unmodifiable. If you do assign the same accessory ID to multiple accessories by mistake, on startup the plugin will skip any accessory that has a duplicate ID and output a message in the logs alerting you to the issue. If you change the value of `accessoryID` after saving the config, HomeKit will interpret the change as the "old" accessory having been deleted and a "new" one added. This will cause the Home app to delete any scenes and automations that use the deleted accessory. Some plugins use the accessory name as the unique ID, which means that you cannot easily change the name. Virtual Accessories For Homebridge uses a dedicated field as the unique ID, allowing you to modify the accessory name, if you so choose to.<p>
I use [random.org](https://www.random.org/) to generate unique IDs. While the plugin only requires 5 digits for the IDs, I use 7-digit values between 1,000,000 and 10,000,000. This provides a range of 9 million possible IDs, which greatly reduces the chances of a duplicate.

> [!NOTE]
> `acccessoryName` is the name that will apppear on the Homekit tile for the accessory, as well as the accessory header in the plugin config. While a unique name is not required, it is recommended to assign different names to each accessory. As Vitual Accessories For Homebridge uses `accessoryID` as the unique identifier, **you can change the accessory name at any time**, if you so choose to. The name change will be propagated to the Home app.

It is recommended to use the Homebridge UI to configure this plugin, as the requirements may vary based on the property value selections. If you choose to manually create or modify the accessory JSON configurations, the following configurations are references and do not cover all of the different value permutations. Please adjust for your requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> Internally HomeKit stores temperature values in Celsius and converts to Fahrenheit on the fly, so when values like 70ºF, you may see values displayed like 70.1ºF or 69.9ºF due to conversions between temperature scales. This is unavoidable.

            }
        }
    ],

}
```

#### Companion sensor with delayed triggering

You can configure a delay before the companion sensor triggers when the switch moves away from its default state. The sensor will immediately return to normal when the switch returns to its default state, cancelling any pending delayed trigger.

```json
{
    "name": "Virtual Accessories Platform",
    "devices": [
        {
            "accessoryID": "1234567",
            "accessoryName": "My Switch",
            "accessoryType": "switch",
            "accessoryIsStateful": false,
            "switch": {
                "defaultState": "off",
                "hasCompanionSensor": true
            },
            "companionSensor": {
                "name": "My Delayed Motion Sensor",
                "type": "motion",
                "delay": {
                    "days": 0,
                    "hours": 0,
                    "minutes": 2,
                    "seconds": 30
                }
            }
        }
    ],
    "platform": "VirtualAccessoriesForHomebridge"
}
```

**Delay behavior:**
- **Triggered state**: Only delayed when moving away from default state (e.g., switch OFF→ON if default is OFF)
- **Normal state**: Immediate when returning to default state, cancels any pending delayed trigger
- **Maximum delay**: 7 days
- **No delay configured**: Sensor triggers immediately (preserves existing behavior)

            }
        }
    ],
    "platform": "VirtualAccessoriesForHomebridge"

> [!NOTE]
> Due to limitations in the current version of one of Homebridge UI's dependencies, the Homebridge UI may save additional fields to the JSON config that may not be relevant to a particular accessory. The JSON config for each individual accessory is validated on startup and extranous fields are ignored. In a future release, the startup validation may perform a config cleanup. However. this does not affect the behavior of the accessories, nor does it hurt to manually remove those fields from the JSON config.

## Webhook Service Configuration

Virtual Accessories For Homebridge includes a webhook service to update accessory sensors via web calls. There are no changes required to individual accessories' configurations. Simply enabling the webhook service will automatically make all supported virtual sensors available. Curently supported accessory sensors are:

- **Humidifier/Dehumidifier humidity sensor.** Updating the humidity sensor will trigger the virtual accessory to switch to the appropriate operating state, based on threshold values and device capabilities.
- **Heater/Cooler temperature sensor.** Updating the temperature sensor will trigger the virtual accessory to switch to the appropriate operating state, based on threshold values and device capabilities.

### Enable webhook service

```json
{
    "name": "Virtual Accessories Platform",
    "sensorServer": {
        "enabled": true
    },
}
```

### Enable webhook service with custom port

```json
{
    "name": "Virtual Accessories Platform",
    "sensorServer": {
        "enabled": true,
        "port": "60221"
    },
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The default port value is `60221`, if no value is specified in the configuratiom. If another service is running on this port, please make sure to select a different port.

Check out the Wiki page [Updating the Humidifier‐Dehumidifier humidity sensor via webhooks](https://github.com/justjam2013/homebridge-virtual-accessories/wiki/Updating-the-Humidifier%E2%80%90Dehumidifier-humidity-sensor-via-webhooks) for detailed steps for setting up a link between a real humidity sensor and the virtual sensor in a virtual humidifer/dehumidifier accessory.

### Update Battery charging state and charge level

To update a Battery charging state and charge level, issue a `POST` request with a raw json payload in the request body. Make sure `Content-Type: application/json` is added to the request headers.

The target URL (replace hostname and port per your setup) will specify the `chargingstate` path:

```
http://localhost:60221/chargingstate
```

The raw json payload will contain the accessory id of the Security System accessory and the charging state and/or the charge level % value:

```json
{
    "id": "1234567",
    "charging": true,
    "charge": 95
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The JSON payload does not have to provide values for both "charging" and "charge". You can specify "charging" only, "charge" only, or both "charging" and "charge". If you do not want to provide one of the values, leave it out of the JSON payload. Ex:
> ```json
> {
>     "id": "1234567",
>     "charge": 95
> }
> ```

## Creative Uses

I started this plugin as a Homebridge 2.0 ready plugin to replace [homebridge-dummy](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge-dummy), which, along with six other plugins, formed the backbone of my HomeKit automations. Then I got some really odd requests, like a window covering. Okay ... what the heck are you going to do with a virtual window covering?? Well, the user who requested it wanted to use "Siri open/close .." to control their trash bin, as opposed to "Siri on/off .." as would be required with switches. Yup, "I use [your plugin] for my trash" is what every plugin developer loves to hear! 🤣 <br/>

So here are creative ways people have used this plugin. Maybe they might inspire others.

His videos are amusing to watch and it's cool to see him use this plugin to solve common day-to-day problems that most people that use HomeKit will encounter at some point.

## Known Issues

#### Issues with Homebridge UI:

-   None currently.

#### Issues with underlying frameworks:

-   There is an issue with the drag-and-drop reordering, where the form layout can get degraded. A bug report has been opened on the framework repo.
-   There is an issue with checkboxes requiring two clicks to uncheck. A bug report has been opened on the framework repo.

#### Issues with HomeKit:

-   The volume on the Doorbell accessory does not work. This is a limitation of Homekit. Per the [HomeKit Accessory Protocol specification](https://forum.iobroker.net/assets/uploads/files/1634848447889-apple-spezifikation-homekit.pdf), the Doorbell is `the primary service of the Video Doorbell Profile.` What that means is that a Doorbell should only be added to HomeKit as part of a Video Doorbell and the Home app will not display a standalone Doorbell. This plugin takes advantage of the fact that, although it is not displayed, the Doorbell is still there and the companion switch allows you to interact with it, leading HomeKit to play a chime on the HomePods. Unfortunately, because the Doorbell is not displayed, you cannot configure which HomePod(s) it connects to and you cannot configure the volume. You can set the volume level in the free [Eve app](https://www.evehome.com/en-us/eve-app), however it will not affect the HomePod volume.

> [!NOTE]
> I considered creating a virtual Video Doorbell accessory, however I ruled it out due to the amount of work required. Also, this functionality is easily implemented with the [Homebridge Camera Ffmpeg](https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg) plugin.
> 
> Without a live feed, you will get a black rectangle in the Home app. Here are a few ways that you can display something instead of that black rectangle:
> - Configure it without setting a valid `source` and setting `stillImageSource` to the URL of an image.
> - Configure it by setting `source` to `"-loop 1 -i http://192.168.4.63:8086/image"` (where `http://192.168.4.63:8086/image` is the URL to a still image) and setting `maxFPS` to `1`.
> - Configure it by setting `source` to a live internet traffic cam or nature cam.
>
> I have not done this myself, so please refer to the plugin documentation for any questions.
